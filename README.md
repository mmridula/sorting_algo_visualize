- This is sorting visualizer which shows different types of sorting algorithm 
- It can solve any given array using five types of sorting algorithm : 
    - Selection sort 
    - Bubble sort 
    - Insertion sort 
    - Merge sort 
    - Quick sort 
- We can also change the number of elements in array and specify the speed of solving .
- We can generate a random new array .
